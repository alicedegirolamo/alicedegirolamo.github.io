									<h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-de-girolamo/">This is me</a></h2>
									<p>I don't use any social network except Linkedin so I would like to present myself (both as a programmer and person) with this site :)</p>

<p>I am a software engineer specialized in real-time applications for 3D, Computer Graphics, Computational Geometry (e.g. CAD and BIM applications) and multimedia (such as game development and VR).
I am really fascinated by software optimization for both CPU and GPU and low-level programming.

<p>I am sorry, but I really do not like full stack development, it's just not for me.</p>

<p>In this portfolio, I don't list projects I worked on during my job experiences (if you are interested in them, please check my Linkedin page). Please, note also the projects have private visibility since many of them are co-created with my colleagues. If you want to read the code, please send me a request.</p>

<p>And now a little bit about me :D</p>

<p>I am a sensible and empathic person. I think these skills make me a good team player. I can understand my colleagues' moods and I can adapt my work style accordingly.</p>
<p>I am a nature lover, I am extremely happy when I go for a walk in the forest. Little things make me happy. I am amazed by leaf autumn colors and relaxed by the rivers sound.</p>

<p>In the past, I wrote many fantasy novels, some of these were even published and won prices :D
I stopped many years to write novels when I started programming :)</p>

<p>I am a smart working supporter. I experienced this work style during the Covid-19 pandemic and my work-life balance improved significantly as well as my productivity (yes, a good job offer for me includes this benefit).
I also think remote work can reduce traffic, overcrowded city, pollution, and other problems. It's time for a change.</p>

<p>I always fight for what I believe in, I am still an optimistic person and I believe everyone can make a difference :)</p>

										<h2>Procedural Mesh generator</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggcgZSemL8" class="image fit"><img src="images/zurutechtest.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was part of my technical interview in my current company (Zuru Tech). All the geometry (tables and chairs) are procedurally generated on the fly, no .objs are loaded. You can create tables and chairs. You can resize the table by dragging one of its four corners and the chairs will resize accordingly. </p> <p><b>Involved technologies:</b> UE4, C++ </p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/alicedgunimi/zurutechtest"><b>Private repo</b></a> </p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ENdgKZfTrIXidZz-NJGl3nHb2nGCw_4?usp=sharing"><b>Resources</b></a></p>

									<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-c_SrxDzcI" class="image fit"><img src="images/mygoodmemories.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a work in progress game I am developing in my spare time.
									I am modeling the level, the characters and do the animations. It is supposed to be a puzzle and point and click mobile game. I want to create a relaxing game. 
									The main character is a little Magnet cat who lives on his peaceful island :)

										<h2>Lucas-Kanade Optical flow</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/gpu.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Gpu computing project exam.</p> 
									<p>I implemented the Lucas-Kanade optical flow on Nvidia Gpu. I tested the algorithm both in global and texture memory and compare them. The application uses the webcam and draws vector in the direction of the movements. In the resources, you can find a short video with the results and my report (unfortunately only in Italian but I think the results and the formulas are still interesting).</p><p><b> Final grade:</b> 30 cum laude /30</p>

									<p>Computational Geometry project exam.</p> 
									<p>I implemented with my colleague, the ocean motion applying the Gerstner wave simulation. The application is web based. The mesh is deformed runtime and it simulates the waves. It is possible to specify some wave parameters. In the resources, you can find the link to our web application with a more detailed algorithm description.</p> <p><b>Final grade</b>: 30 cum laude /30</p>

									<p>Real-time graphics programming project exam.</p> 
									<p>I implemented with my colleague a real-time application with a focus on graphics programming from scratch. We implemented a simple 3D engine with some features. The scene is a show-case for some techniques. The engine has dynamic point and spot lights, post-processing effects (such as bloom and blur), physical-based illumination model, materials management, subsurface scattering approximation, 3D navigation system, 3D animation management.</p><p><b>Final grade:</b> 30 cum laude/ 30.</p>

									<p>Intelligent Systems project exam.</p> 
									<p>I implemented with my colleague a real-time application for an intelligent AI harvesting system on a space base. We implemented the ID3 algorithm. The space ship simulates the scarcity of water and other resources randomly. The system has memory of different actions (such as harvest, wet, fertilize etc) for different types of plants and has to optimize the harvest.</p><p><b>Final grade:</b> 25/30</p>

										<h2>Hide and Seek</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ai.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Artificial intelligence for video games project exam.</p>
<p>Videogame I implemented with my colleague for AI design. I also designed the labyrinth in which the AI moves. The AI is designed to seek the player who has to hide. The AI performs a patrol in each room based on several behavior trees. You can also find a "sentinel" in the room which is triggered by the player and marks the room with different grades of severity for the AI. The AI has many behavior trees, a movement system, and a vision system.</p><p><b>Final grade:</b> 30 /30</p><p><b>Involved technologies:</b> C#, Unity3D </p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/alicedgunimi/HideAndSeekAi.git "><b>Private repo</b></a> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZaQpgYFfmZ9vmMwsYdzhRjlTrEBA_Nc?usp=sharing"><b>Resources</b></a></p>

										<h2>Pharmageddon</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/467BJysveco" class="image fit"><img src="images/pharmageddon.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Online game design project exam.</p>
<p>Multiplayer videogame I implemented with two colleagues.	Pharmageddon is a crazy fps videogame. Each character has its own strange abilities and weakness. The concept is based on pharma which can be mixed, so for example you can be a coffee-junkie who fires coffee cups and be very weak if you get hit by a hypochondriac granny who fires candies. You can mix different drug effects, if you get hit by your ally you can become stronger or weaker. Build well your team strategy! Yes, we know, it's a crazy game. For this game we won the New Game Designer competition sponsored by Ubisoft and the Best Visual Graphics Effects award by EDI, effetti italiani digitali.</p><p><b>Final grade:</b> 30 cum laude/30</p> <p><b>Involved technologies:</b> C#, Unity3D </p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/stefano_pittalis/pharmageddon-ogd/src/master/"><b>Private repo</b></a> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1svofiFDGSt5kF8w2-gxr--NlYTOCGwmq?usp=sharing"><b>Resources</b></a></p>

										<h2>Couch Raider</h2>
									</header>
									<a  href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZXdbEMc47s" class="image fit"><img src="images/couch_raider.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Videogame design and programming project exam.</p>
									<p>Platform videogame I implemented with two colleagues. The game is a classical platformer with an action component in a revolutionary circular map.

In Couch Raider you play as Lara, a little girl seeking for her favorite toy: Suzanne the Monkey.

As every kid does, Lara imagines incredible adventures while she plays: the floor is lava, the Couch is a fortress, a toy became a treasure…

As you proceed in the circular world you will dive in Lara's imagination, from the comfort of her house to the dangers of the hidden Temple of The Monkey.

You'll have to find useful objects around to avoid traps and defeat enemies as a real archaeologist, hem… I mean… explorer (George Lucas & Steven Spielberg don't sue me, please).

This is not a simple child adventure, Lara is going to encounter many DANGEROUS obstacles : are you ready?!	</p><p><b>Final grade</b>: 30 cum laude/30</p>
